excerpt: "Want to analyze real-world AI performance? Use AIBench instead of MLPerf, says AIBench developers:&hellip;Chinese universities and 17 companies come together to develop AI measurement approach&hellip;A consortium of Chinese universities along with seventeen companies &ndash; including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and ByteDance &ndash; have developed AIBench, an AI benchmarking suite meant to compete with MLPerf, an AI benchmarking suite predominantly developed by American universities and companies. AIBench is interesting because it proposes ways to do fine-grained analysis of a given AI application, which could help developers make their software more efficient. It&rsquo;s also interesting because of the sheer number of major Chinese companies involved, and in its explicit positioning as an alternative to MLPerf.End-to-end application benchmarks: AIBench is meant to test tasks in an end-to-end way, covering both the AI and non-AI components. Some of the tasks it tests against include: recommendation tasks, 3D face recognition, face embedding (turning faces into features), video prediction, image compression, speech recognition, and more. This means AIBench can measure various real-world metrics, like the latency of a given task that reflects the time it takes to execute the AI part, as well as the surrounding infrastructure software services, and so on.Fine-grained analysis: AIBench will help researchers figure out what proportion of time their systems spend doing different things while executing a program, helping them figure out, for instance, how much time is spent doing data arrangement for a task versus running convolution operations, or batch normalization, and so on.The politics of measurement: It&rsquo;s no coincidence that most of AIBench&rsquo;s backers are Chinese and most of MLPerf&rsquo;s backers are American &ndash; measurement is intimately tied to the development of standards, and standards are one of the (extraordinarily dull) venues where US and Chinese entities are currently jockeying for influence with one another. Systems like AIBench will generate valuable data about the performance of contemporary AI applications, while also supporting various second-order political goals.

US government wants AI systems that can understand an entire movie:&hellip;NIST&rsquo;s painstakingly annotated HLVU dataset sets new AI video analysis challenges&hellip;Researchers with NIST, a US government agency dedicated to assessing and measuring different aspects of technology, want to build a video understanding dataset that tests out AI inference capabilities on feature-length movies. Why video modelling is hard (and what makes HLVU different): Video modelling is an extremely challenging problem for AI systems &ndash; it takes all the hard parts of image recognition, then makes them harder by adding a temporal element which requires you to isolate objects in scenes then track them from frame to frame while pixels change. So far, much of the work on video modeling has come along in the form of narrow tasks, like being able to accurately recognize different types of movements in the &lsquo;ActivityNet&rsquo; dataset, or characterize individual actions in things like DeepMind&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kinetics&rsquo; stuff. What HLVU is: The High-Level Video Understanding (HLVU) dataset is meant to help researchers develop algorithms that can understand entire movies. Specifically, today HLVU consists of 11 hours of heavily annotated footage across a multitude of open source movies, collected from Vimeo and . NIST is currently paying volunteers to annotate the movies using a graphing tool called yEd to help create knowledge graphs about the movies &ndash; e.g., describing how characters are related to eachother. This means competition participants might be confronted with a couple of images of a couple of characters then allowed to have their algorithms &lsquo;watch&rsquo; the movie, after which they&rsquo;d be expected to discuss the relationship of the two characters. This is a challenging, open-ended task. Why this matters: HLVU is a &lsquo;moonshot problem&rsquo;, in the sense that it seems amazingly hard for today&rsquo;s existing systems to solve it out of the box, and building systems that can understand full-length movies will likely require systems that are able to cope with larger contexts during training, and which may come with some augmented symbol-manipulation machinery to help them figure out relationships between representations (although graph neural network approaches might work here, also). Progress on HLVU will provide us with valuable signals about the relative maturity of different bits of AI technology. &nbsp; Read more: HLVU: A New Challenge to Test Deep Understanding of Movies the Way Humans do (arXiv). ####################################################CyberpunkAI &ndash; Facebook turns NetHack into an OpenAI Gym environment:&hellip;AI like it&rsquo;s 1987!&hellip; When you think of recent highlights in reinforcement learning research you&rsquo;re likely to contemplate things like StarCraft and Dota-playing bots, or robots learning to manipulate objects. You&rsquo;re less likely to think of games with ASCII graphics from decades ago. Yet a team of Facebook-led researchers think NetHack, a famous roguelike game first launched in 1987, is a good candidate for contemporary AI research, and have released the Nethack Learning Environment to encourage researchers to pit AI agents against the ancient game.Why NetHack:&nbsp;
Cheap: The ASCII-based game has a tiny computational footprint, which means many different researchers will be able to conduct research on it.&nbsp;
Complex: NetHack worlds are procedurally generated, so an AI agent can&rsquo;t memorize the level. Additionally, NetHack contains hundreds of monsters and items, introducing further challenges.&nbsp;
Simple: The researchers have implemented it as an OpenAI Gym environment, so you can run it within a simple, pre-existing software stack.&nbsp;
Fast: A standard CNN-based agent can iterate through NetHack environments at 5000 steps per second, letting them gather a lot of experience in a relatively short amount of (human) time.
Reassuringly challenging: The researchers train an IMPALA-style model to solve some basic NetHack tasks relating to actions and navigation and find that it struggles on a couple of them, suggesting the environment will pose a challenge and demand the creation of new algorithms with new ideas.&nbsp;
Things that make you go &lsquo;hmmm&rsquo;: One tantalizing idea here is that people may need to use RL+Text-understanding techniques to &lsquo;solve&rsquo; NetHack: &ldquo;Almost all human players learn to master the game by consulting the NetHack Wiki, or other so-called spoilers, making NLE a testbed for advancing language-assisted RL,&rdquo; writes Facebook AI researcher Tim Rockt&auml;schel.Why this matters: If NetHack becomes established, then researchers will be able to use a low-cost, fast platform to rapidly prototype complex reinforcement learning research ideas &ndash; something that today is mostly done through the use of expensive (aka, costly-to-run) game engines, or complex robotics simulations. Plus, it&rsquo;d be nice to watch Twitch streams of trained agents exploring the ancient game.  &nbsp; Get the code from Facebook&rsquo;s GitHub here. &nbsp; Read more: The NetHack Learning Environment (PDF).####################################################How AI lets Cloudflare block internet bots:&hellip;Is it a bot?
