### Automated monitoring of your machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor and sending predictions to human review workflows using Amazon A2I | Amazon Web Services

When machine learning (ML) is deployed in production, monitoring the model is important for maintaining the quality of predictions. Although the statistical properties of the training data are known in advance, real-life data can gradually deviate over time and impact the prediction results of your model, a phenomenon known as data drift. Detecting these conditions […]
