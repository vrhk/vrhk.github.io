### A dopamine layer used to train "connections" between neurons in a TensorFlow2 neural network, which may be a dropout replacement in the future[Discussion]

Recently studying TensorFlow, I learned that we will use the Dropout trick to solve the over-fitting problem of fully connected neural networks. I...
