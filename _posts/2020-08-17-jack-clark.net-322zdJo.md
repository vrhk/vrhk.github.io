excerpt: "Deepfakes are the most worrying-crimes &ndash; UCL researchers:Deepfakes, specifically audio/video impersonation of someone for criminal purposes, are the greatest AI-driven crime threat, according to research from UCL published in the journal Crime Science. The research is based on a two-day workshop that occurred in early 2019, which had 31 attendants from the public sector (including the UK&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Center), academia, and the private sector. At the workshop, attendees shared research on a variety of different AI-driven crime threats, then got together and ranked 20 of them from low to high threats, across four dimensions for each crime (harm, profit, achievability, defeatability). The top threats: The things to be most worried about are audio/video impersonation, followed by tailored phishing campaigns and driverless vehicles being used as weapons. The least worrying threats: Some of the least worrying threats include forgery, AI-authored fake reviews, and AI-assisted stalking, according to the attendees.Things that make you go &lsquo;hmmm&rsquo;: Some of the threats that required decent text generation capabilities were ranked as being fairly hard to achieve &ndash; I wonder how much that threat landscape has changed, given the NLP advancements in past year and a half (e.g, GPT2, GPT3, CTRL, et cetera).  &nbsp; Read the research: AI-enabled future crime (BMC Crime Science, open access). &nbsp; Read more: &lsquo;Deepfakes&rsquo; ranked as most serious AI crime threat (UCL News).###################################################SpaceCraft collision detection &ndash; surprisingly hard for ML:&hellip;Competition results mean ML isn&rsquo;t the greatest fit for averting Kessler Syndrome, yet&hellip;How well can machine learning approaches predict the possibility of satellites colliding with one another &ndash; not well, according to the results of a competition, the Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge, hosted by the European Space Agency.
