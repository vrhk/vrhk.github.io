excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise across domains such as predictive analysis, speech processing, image recognition, recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and more. Training ML models is a time- and compute-intensive process, requiring multiple training runs with different hyperparameters before a model yields acceptable accuracy. CPU- and GPU-based distributed training with frameworks such as Horovod and […]"

### Identify bottlenecks, improve resource utilization, and reduce ML training costs with the deep profiling feature in Amazon SageMaker Debugger | Amazon Web Services

Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise across domains such as predictive analysis, speech processing, image recognition, recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and more. Training ML models is a time- and compute-intensive process, requiring multiple training runs with different hyperparameters before a model yields acceptable accuracy.
