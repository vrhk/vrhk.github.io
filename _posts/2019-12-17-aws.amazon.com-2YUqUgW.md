### Running distributed TensorFlow training with Amazon SageMaker | Amazon Web Services

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning (ML) library widely used to develop heavy-weight deep neural networks (DNNs) that require distributed training using multiple GPUs across multiple hosts. Amazon SageMaker is a managed service that simplifies the ML workflow, starting with labeling data using active learning, hyperparameter tuning, distributed training of models, monitoring of training progression, […]
