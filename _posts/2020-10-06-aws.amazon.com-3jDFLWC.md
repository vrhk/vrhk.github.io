### Achieving 1.85x higher performance for deep learning based object detection with an AWS Neuron compiled YOLOv4 model on AWS Inferentia | Amazon Web Services

In this post, we show you how to deploy a TensorFlow based YOLOv4 model, using Keras optimized for inference on AWS Inferentia based Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances. You will set up a benchmarking environment to evaluate throughput and precision, comparing Inf1 with comparable Amazon EC2 G4 GPU-based instances. Deploying YOLOv4 on AWS Inferentia provides the […]
