### Active Vision and Perception in Human-Robot Collaboration

Humans naturally interact and collaborate in unstructured social environments that produce an overwhelming amount of information and may yet hide behaviorally relevant variables. Finding the underlying design principles that allow humans to adaptively find and select relevant information is important for Roboticsbut also other fields, such as Computational Neuroscience and Interaction Design.Current solutions cover specific tasks, e.g. autonomous cars, and usually employ over-redundant, expensive, and computationally demanding sensory systems that attempt to cover the wide set of sensing conditions which the systems may have to deal with. Adaptive control of the sensors and of the perception process is a key solution found by nature to cope with such problems, as shown by the foveal anatomy of the eye and its high mobility.Alongside this interest in “active” vision, collaborative robotics has recently progressed to human-robot interaction in real manufacturing.
