excerpt: "AI and ML products now permeate every aspect of our digital lives–from recommendations of what to watch, to divining our search intent, to powering increasingly-present virtual assistants in consumer and enterprise settings. While quality improvements are the main focus of traditional ML and AI research, a second and arguably less well understood benefit of machine learning is that it can dramatically reshape the practice of building applications. With an eye toward generations of compiler, database, and operating systems work, they may inspire new foundational questions for how to build the next generation of AI-powered systems."

### The Coming Wave of ML Systems

AI and ML products now permeate every aspect of our digital lives–from recommendations of what to watch, to divining our search intent, to powering increasingly-present virtual assistants in consumer and enterprise settings. While quality improvements are the main focus of traditional ML and AI research, a second and arguably less well understood benefit of machine learning is that it can dramatically reshape the practice of building applications. With an eye toward generations of compiler, database, and operating systems work, they may inspire new foundational questions for how to build the next generation of AI-powered systems.
