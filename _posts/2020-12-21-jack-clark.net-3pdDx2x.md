excerpt: "China might be using AI to synthesize whale songs for its military:&hellip;The future of warfare: whalesong steganography&hellip;China has been trying to synthesize the sounds of whales and dolphins, potentially as a way to encode secret messages to direct submarines and other submersible machines, according to a somewhat speculative article in Hakai Magazine.&ldquo;Modern technological advances in sensors and computing have allowed Chinese researchers at Harbin Engineering University and Tianjin University to potentially overcome some of those prior limitations. A long list of papers from both universities discusses analyzing and synthesizing the sounds from dolphins, killer whales, false killer whales, pilot whales, sperm whales, and humpback whales&mdash;all pointing to the possibility of creating artificially generated marine mammal sounds to send more customized messages,&rdquo; writes journalist Jeremy Hsu.Why this matters: For a lot of AI technology, there are two scientific games being played: a superficial game oriented around a narrowly specified capability, like trying to identify animals in photos from cameras in national parks, or synthesizing whale sounds. The second game is one played by the military and intelligence community, which funds a huge amount of AI research, and usually involves taking the narrow capabilities of the former and secretly converting them to a capability to be fielded for the purposes of security. It&rsquo;s worth remembering that, for most trends in AI research, both games are being played at the same time.&nbsp; Read more: The Military Wants to Hide Covert Messages in Marine Mammal Sounds (Hakai magazine).###################################################What 36 experts think is needed for fair AI in India:&hellip;Think you can apply US-centric practices to India?
