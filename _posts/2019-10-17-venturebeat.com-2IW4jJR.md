### Google taps evolution for state-of-the-art AI video understanding models

Video understanding is an AI subfield that not only underpins systems capable of sussing out semantics automatically, like web-video classifiers and sport activity recognizers, but that’s at the cornerstone of robot perception and navigation systems. Unfortunately, devising machine learning models that take advantage of videos’ spatio-temporal information isn’t easy, nor is identifying those that aren’t …
