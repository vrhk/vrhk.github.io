### Identifying training bottlenecks and system resource under-utilization with Amazon SageMaker Debugger | Amazon Web Services

At AWS re:Invent 2020, AWS released the profiling functionality for Amazon SageMaker Debugger. In this post, we expand on the importance of profiling deep neural network (DNN) training, review some of the common performance bottlenecks you might encounter, and demonstrate how to use the profiling feature in Debugger to detect such bottlenecks. In the context […]
