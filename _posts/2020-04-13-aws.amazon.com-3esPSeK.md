### Reduce inference costs on Amazon EC2 for PyTorch models with Amazon Elastic Inference | Amazon Web Services

You can now use Amazon Elastic Inference to accelerate inference and reduce inference costs for PyTorch models in both Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EC2. PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that uses dynamic computational graphs. This allows you to easily develop deep learning models with imperative and idiomatic Python code. Inference is the process […]
