The Earth’s climate is a highly complex, dynamic system. It is difficult to understand and predict how different climate variables interact. Finding causal relations in climate research today relies mostly on expensive and time-consuming model simulations. Fortunately, with the explosion in the availability of large-scale climate data and increasing computational power via the cloud, there […]
