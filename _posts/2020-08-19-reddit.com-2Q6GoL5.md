### [D] I know the theory of ML and related algorithms. Can I directly start learning Deep Learning and Neural Networks now or should I focus on implementing and learning more about Machine learning in depth? I want to eventually work in Computer Vision and/or NLP.

I am leaning towards Computer Vision and plan to go for Masters in AI in 1-2 years. I was wondering since I already know the theory behind ML...
