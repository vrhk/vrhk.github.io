excerpt: "Could this one-armed mobile robot be the next big thing?&hellip;Rise of the machines (again)&hellip;A seasoned team of roboticists hailing from Google and Georgia Tech have developed Stretch, a (relatively) low cost, mobile robot. Why Stretch? Stretch has a few features that make it potentially interesting to researchers &ndash; it sits on a stable, simple wheeled base, has one arm with a reasonably robust (and simple!) gripper, onboard cameras, and has been built for easy modification (e.g, swapping out different manipulators or other items onto its arm). The robot costs $17,950, with discounts available if you buy more (six costs you around $100k). Why this matters: Most AI researchers think robots are gong to be an important part of the future, but most AI researchers also acknowledge that robots are insanely difficult to get right, and that they&rsquo;re unforgiving about the deficiencies of today&rsquo;s approaches. Stretch is part of a new wave of robots that, unlike prior generations (e.g, the PR2) have been built out of lower cost components with simpler bodies. (Another good example of this is Berkeley&rsquo;s low-cost $5k &lsquo;BLUE&rsquo; robot arm, covered in Import AI 142).Read more about the technical details of the robot here (Hello Robot, official website).

To train its self-driving cars, google built a simulation of the miniature town in Unity then used data-augmentation techniques to create a bunch of data, which was used to train the miniature self-driving &ldquo;cars&rdquo;.Why this matters: Pixelopolis was originally meant to be a marketing demo that you could see at events like Google I/O &ndash; then the Coronavirus happened. Now, the writeup by Google of the demo serves as an interesting outline of what can be accomplished using cheap or open source tools in 2019 and 2020 when it comes to AI. I think if you got in a time machine and went to 2010, people would be fairly surprised that we&rsquo;d developed a) decent object detection systems via neural networks and b) that these systems could run on smartphones, providing local computation to miniature robots. (Some people might have been disappointed by you, though, as there was a faction in Silicon Valley in the early 2010s that seemed to think self-driving cars were single-digit years away. &nbsp; Read more: Sharing Pixelopolis, a self-driving car demo from Google I/O built with TF-Lite (arXiv).

And so much more&hellip;The Library of Congress has released more than 11,000 images of roadside attractions in the US &ndash; this is a potentially cool dataset for AI tinkerers (just imagine the StyleGAN possibilities, for instance!).

Every empire worth its salt ultimately needs to build machines that let it extend itself &ndash; it&rsquo;s not by chance that the romans invested vast amounts of money into building roads, that oil companies invested in oil platforms, or that America invested a huge amount in a globe-spanning set of military bases. Now, Facebook is getting in on the action with a robot that can deploy high-capacity fibre-optic cables on medium-voltage power lines. Facebook thinks the technology &ldquo;will allow fiber to effectively and sustainably be deployed within a few hundred meters of much of the world&rsquo;s population&rdquo;, and the company will trial the tech later this year. &ndash; Sidenote: This all feels a lot creepier if you imagine instead of Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook is Julius Caesar, and instead of a robot that builds fibre, we&rsquo;re talking about a system to bring rapid-troop-transport tech to &ldquo;a few hundred meters&rsquo; of most of the world.
