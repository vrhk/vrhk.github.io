### Using the AWS DeepRacer new Soft Actor Critic algorithm with continuous action spaces | Amazon Web Services

AWS DeepRacer is the fastest way to get started with machine learning (ML). You can train reinforcement learning (RL) models by using a 1/18th scale autonomous vehicle in a cloud-based virtual simulator and compete for prizes and glory in the global AWS DeepRacer League. We’re excited to bring you two new features available on the […]
