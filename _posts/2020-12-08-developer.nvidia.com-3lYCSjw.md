excerpt: "In the first post on ray-traced caustic effects, we introduced mesh caustics and its usages in Unreal Engine 4. In this second post, we describe water causoduction of automated and autonomous vehicles. It scales from a palm-sized, energy efficient module for AutoCruise capabilities, to a powerful AI supercomputer capable of autonomous driving."

### Generating Ray-Traced Caustic Effects in Unreal Engine 4, Part 2 | NVIDIA Developer Blog

In the first post on ray-traced caustic effects, we introduced mesh caustics and its usages in Unreal Engine 4. In this second post, we describe water causoduction of automated and autonomous vehicles. It scales from a palm-sized, energy efficient module for AutoCruise capabilities, to a powerful AI supercomputer capable of autonomous driving.
