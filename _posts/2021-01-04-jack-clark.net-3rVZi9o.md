excerpt: "Finally &ndash; the US government passes a bunch of AI legislation:&hellip;Senate and the House overall POTUS veto; NDAA passes&hellip;The US government is finally getting serious about artificial intelligence, thanks to the passing of the NDAA &ndash; a mammoth military funding bill that includes a ton of different bits of AI legislation within itself. There&rsquo;s a rundown of the contents of the bill in Import AI 228 (made possible by an excellent rundown by Stanford HAI). The US President tried to veto the bill, but the House and Senate overruled the POTUS veto. Why this matters: AI has so many potential benefits (and harms) that it&rsquo;s helpful to invest some public money in supporting AI development, analyzing it, and better equipping governments to use AI and understand it. The legislation in the NDAA will make the US better prepared to take advantage of an AI era. Though it&rsquo;s a shame that we&rsquo;ve had to wait in some cases years for this legislation to get passed as the weirdly politicised legislative environment of the US means most big stuff needs to get stapled to a larger omnibus funding bill to pass.  &nbsp; Read more: Republican-led Senate overrides Trump defense bill veto in rare New Year&rsquo;s Day session (CNBC).###################################################Boston Dynamics robots take dance classes:&hellip;Surprisingly flexible hilarity ensues&hellip;Boston Dynamics, the robot company, has published a video of its robots carrying out a range of impressive dance moves, including jumps, complex footwork, synchronized moves, and more.&nbsp; Check it out: you deserve it.

It&rsquo;ll be a while before I have much to say about that. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be continuing to keep doing research into AI assessment and I&rsquo;ll still be working in AI policy at a range of organizations. Import AI has always been a personal project and it&rsquo;s been one of the great joys of my life to write it and grow it and talk with so many of you readers. And it&rsquo;s going to keep going!&ndash; I&rsquo;ll also be shortly announcing the 2021 AI Index Report, a project I co-chair at Stanford University, which will include a bunch of graphs analyzing AI progress in recent years, so keep your eyes peel for that.###################################################Graphcore raises $222 million Series E:&hellip;Non-standard chip company gets significant cash infusion&hellip;Graphcore has raised a couple of hundred million in Series E financing, as institutional investors (e.g, the Ontario Teachers&rsquo; Pension Plan, Baillie Gifford) bet that the market for non-standard chips is about to go FOOM. Graphcore is developing chips, called IPUs (Intelligence Processing Unit), which are designed to compete with chips from NVIDIA and AMD (GPUs) and Google (TPUs) for the fast-growing market for chips for training AI systems.Why this matters: As AI gets more important, people are going to want to buy more efficient AI hardware, so they get more bang for their computational buck. But doing a chip startup is very hard: the history of semiconductors is littered with the bodies of companies that tried to compete with companies like Intel and NVIDIA at substituting for their chips (remember Tilera? Calxeda? etc), but something changed recently: AI became a big deal while AI technology was relatively inefficient; NVIDIA took advantage of this by investing in software to get its naturally parallel processors (it&rsquo;s a short jump from modeling thousands of polygons on a screen in parallel for gaming purposes, to doing parallel matrix multiplications) to be a good fit for AI. That worked for a while, but now companies like Graphcore and Cerebras systems are trying to capture the market by making efficient chips, custom-designed for the needs of AI workloads. There&rsquo;s already some promising evidence their chips can do stuff better than others (see benchmarks from Import AI 66) At some point, someone will crack this problem and the world will get a new, more efficient set of substrates to train and run AI systems on.

That&rsquo;s both a good and a bad thing. It&rsquo;s good, because SuperGLUE challenges an AI system to do well at a suite of distinct tests, so good scores on SuperGLUE indicate a decent amount of generality. It&rsquo;s bad, because SuperGLUE was launched in early 2019 (Import AI: 143) after surprisingly rapid NLP progress had saturated the prior &lsquo;GLUE&rsquo; benchmark. Who did it: Google currently leads the SuperGLUE leaderboard, with an aggregate score of 90 (compared to 89.8 for human baselines on SuperGLUE). Microsoft very briefly held the winning position with a score of 89.9, before being beaten by Google in the final days of 2020.Why this matters: How meaningful are recent advances in natural language processing? Tests like SuperGLUE are designed to give us a signal. But if we&rsquo;ve saturated the benchmark, how do we know what additional progress means? We need new, harder benchmarks. There are some candidates out there &ndash; the Dynabench eval suite includes &lsquo;far from solved benchmarks&lsquo; for tasks like NLI, QA, Sentiment, and Hate Speech. But my intuition is we need even more tests than this, and we&rsquo;ll need to assemble them into suites to better understand how to analyze these machines. &nbsp; Check out the SuperGLUE leaderboard here.###################################################Want to use AI to spot malware?

Yes or no) to classify files, SOREL providers finer-grained descriptions; if the sample includes malware, it might also be classified according to type, eg &lsquo;Crypto_miner&rsquo;, &lsquo;File_infector&rsquo;, &lsquo;Dropper&rsquo;, etc. This will make it easier for developers to build smarter AI-driven classification systems.Pre-trained models: The release includes pre-trained PyTorch and LightGBM models, which developers can use to get started.
