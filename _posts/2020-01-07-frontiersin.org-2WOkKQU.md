### Enriching Social Awareness in Artificial Agents: Advances in Physiological and Behavioural Signal Processing

Social robots and virtual avatars are emerging technologies that promise opportunities for an effective interaction with humans. This ability emerges from a coherent exploitation of social skills that explicitly take into account the human presence in the perception-action loop. Identifying users, understanding their actions, inferring their mental and emotional states, processing non-verbal gestures, planning their action in a more “human-aware” fashion, are just some examples of social skills that are pushing interactive agents towards an efficient and practical collaboration with humans in different scenarios; as partners in industries, as companions for children and elderly, as educational tools, as assistants in public or personal spaces and so on.
