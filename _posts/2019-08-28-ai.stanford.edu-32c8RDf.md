excerpt: "Figure 1: Comparison of existing algorithms without policy certificates (top) and with our proposed policy certificates (bottom). While in existing reinforcement learning the user has no information about how well the algorithm will perform in the next episode, we propose that algorithms output policy certificates before playing an episode to allow users to intervene if necessary."

### Policy Certificates and Minimax-Optimal PAC Bounds for Episodic Reinforcement Learning

Figure 1: Comparison of existing algorithms without policy certificates (top) and with our proposed policy certificates (bottom). While in existing reinforcement learning the user has no information about how well the algorithm will perform in the next episode, we propose that algorithms output policy certificates before playing an episode to allow users to intervene if necessary.
