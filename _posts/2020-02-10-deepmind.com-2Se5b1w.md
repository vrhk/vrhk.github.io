### A new model and dataset for long-range memory

This blog introduces a new long-range memory model, the Compressive Transformer, alongside a new benchmark for book-level language modelling, PG19. We provide the conceptual tools needed to understand this new research in the context of recent developments in memory models and language modelling.
