### “Liquid” machine-learning system adapts to changing conditions

MIT researchers developed a neural network that learns on the job, not just during training. The “liquid” network varies its equations’ parameters, enhancing its ability to analyze time series data. The advance could boost autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and more.
