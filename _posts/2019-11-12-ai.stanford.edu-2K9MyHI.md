excerpt: "For the nearly one million American adults living with physical disabilities, taking a bite of food or pouring a glass of water presents a significant challenge. Assistive robots—such as wheelchair-mounted robotic arms—promise to solve this problem. Users control these robots by interacting with a joystick, guiding the robot arm to complete everyday tasks without relying on a human caregiver. Unfortunately, the very dexterity that makes these arms useful also renders them difficult for users to control. Our insight is that we can make assistive robots easier for humans to control by learning an intuitive and meaningful control mapping that translates simple joystick motions into complex robot behavior. In this blog post, we describe our self-supervised algorithm for learning the latent space, and summarize the results of user studies that test our approach on cooking and eating tasks. You can find a more in-depth description in this paper and the accompanying video."

### Controlling Assistive Robots with Learned Latent Actions

For the nearly one million American adults living with physical disabilities, taking a bite of food or pouring a glass of water presents a significant challenge. Assistive robots—such as wheelchair-mounted robotic arms—promise to solve this problem. Users control these robots by interacting with a joystick, guiding the robot arm to complete everyday tasks without relying on a human caregiver. Unfortunately, the very dexterity that makes these arms useful also renders them difficult for users to control. Our insight is that we can make assistive robots easier for humans to control by learning an intuitive and meaningful control mapping that translates simple joystick motions into complex robot behavior. In this blog post, we describe our self-supervised algorithm for learning the latent space, and summarize the results of user studies that test our approach on cooking and eating tasks.
