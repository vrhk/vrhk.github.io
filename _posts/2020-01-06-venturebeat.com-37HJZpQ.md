### DeepMind researchers introduce hybrid solution to robot control problems

Fundamental problems in robotics involve both discrete variables, like the choice of control modes or gear switching), and continuous variables, like velocity setpoints and control gains. They’re often difficult to tackle, because it’s not always obvious which algorithms or control policies might best fit. That’s why researchers at Google parent company Alphabet’s DeepMind recently proposed …
