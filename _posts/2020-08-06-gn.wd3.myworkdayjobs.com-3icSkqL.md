excerpt: "Deep neural networks. Machine Learning. Digital signal processing. Does that sound good in your ears? Join us to explore these topics together with an extensive network of specialists from around the world and contribute to their application in products that make life sound better. We make life sound better At GN Audio, we work to lead major technology shifts with intelligent audio solutions. Through our Jabra and BlueParrott brands, we provide headsets, speakerphones and video conference equipment designed to deliver high-quality communication and listening experiences. To keep us ahead of the game, we have a dedicated Audio Research group in Ballerup, with research scientists and other talented colleagues, leading the search for new algorithms and technologies to ensure that our products are the very best performing audio products on the market. Push the barriers of technology and sound Your main mission will be to help us develop new and innovative sound processing algorithms and methods. To do so, you will explore the fields of speech audio signal processing, deep neural networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more, as you drive early research through maturation to tangible results. More specifically, you will: Explore and propose feasible solution realizations Setup and reproduce experiments from academic papers or external partners Implement demonstrations in real time Verify performances in our acoustical lab Present results and pitch feasible applications to relevant functions such as Product Management and Product Development Contribute to our intellectual property portfolio by submitting ideas to our patent department “Your work will be driven by the needs of the organization, but there is also room for you to let your curiosity lead the way, as you read publications, attend conferences and undertake other explorations with potential for relevant discoveries,” says Leo Larsen, Senior Director of Audio Research. Join a global league of experts Knowledge sharing is an integral part of our success. Therefore, we have built an extensive network around the world with which we collaborate on research programs and follow closely to stay informed on what is happening in the academic fields. We also contribute to the field ourselves, by presenting parts of our research at conferences and papers around the world. Joining us, you will take part in this unique network of universities, partners, scientists, PhD students and other specialists within the fields of acoustics, audiology, neuroscience, human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence.
