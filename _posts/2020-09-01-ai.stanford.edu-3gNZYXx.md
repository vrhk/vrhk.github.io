excerpt: "With autonomous systems becoming more capable, they are entering into safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and healthcare. Ensuring the safe operations of these systems is a crucial step before they can be deployed and accepted by our society. Failure to perform the proper degree of safety validation can risk the loss of property or even human life."

### Safety Validation of Black-Box Autonomous Systems

With autonomous systems becoming more capable, they are entering into safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and healthcare. Ensuring the safe operations of these systems is a crucial step before they can be deployed and accepted by our society. Failure to perform the proper degree of safety validation can risk the loss of property or even human life.
