excerpt: "We projected head-dependent pairs from both English (light colors) and French (dark colors) into a syntactic space trained on solely English mBERT representations. Both English and French head-dependent vectors cluster; dependencies of the same label in both English and French share the same cluster. Although our method has no access to dependency labels, the dependencies exhibit cross-lingual clustering that largely agree with linguists’ categorizations."

### Finding Cross-Lingual Syntax in Multilingual BERT

We projected head-dependent pairs from both English (light colors) and French (dark colors) into a syntactic space trained on solely English mBERT representations. Both English and French head-dependent vectors cluster; dependencies of the same label in both English and French share the same cluster. Although our method has no access to dependency labels, the dependencies exhibit cross-lingual clustering that largely agree with linguists’ categorizations.
