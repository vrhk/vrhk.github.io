excerpt: "Second workshop on Applications of Egocentric Vision (EgoApp) is organized in conjunction with ICPR2020 The&nbsp;25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Milan, Italy, January 10-15, 2021







EgoApp aims to bring together diverse communities related to egocentric vision, such as computer science, robotics, and social science to discuss the current and next generation of related technologies. To this end, both research and industry communities are invited to submit their recent outcomes in the format of a research or a position paper.



The current edition of the workshop, in addition to covering the conventional topics around applications of egocentric vision, aims to deal with visual perception of robot environment with special emphasis on methodologies and approaches for analysis of images and videos acquired from the point of view of a robot. In contrast to conventional computer vision settings, robots sense the environment while they interact. They can acquire large amounts of information, which is however challenging to be processed. Typically, images from robots are much lower resolution and may be affected by motion blur. Objects seen by a robot may undergo important transformations (i.e. scale and point of view), and may be partially occluded by the hands of the robot during manipulation. Overall, this pose important challenges for learning and recognition



Submissions are expected to deal with egocentric vision and robotic visual perception, including, but not limited to:



Wearable technologies for egocentric vision acquisition, computation, and perceptionAssistive technologies for personalized monitoringObject detection and recognition from egocentric visionAugmented and Mixed Reality applications&nbsp;Person identification in egocentric videosActivity recognition in egocentric visionVisual lifelogging and summarization of egocentric videosScene understanding from egocentric visionHuman computer/robot interaction using egocentric visionSocial signal analysis and behaviour modelling in egocentric vision Affective computing in egocentric visionUnderstanding of group dynamics in egocentric visionAttention, fixation, and saliency modelling and predictionPerception in virtual and augmented realityEthics and social issues in egocentric visionActive learningDomain adaptation from allocentric to egocentric visionImage segmentation and object pose tracking
