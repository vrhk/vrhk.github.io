We aim to learn the secret of the brain and build machine intelligence. Our mission is not limited to building algorithms for a single intelligence, but we also aim to build a network (society) of machine intelligences.



Our research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Network Science and Brain Science (computational neuroscience).
