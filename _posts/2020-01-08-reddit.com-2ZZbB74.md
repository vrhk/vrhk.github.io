### [D] Why do Variational Autoencoders encode each datapoint to an individual normal distribution over z, rather than forcing all encodings Z to be normally distributed?

As in the title. Variational autoencoders encode each data sample x_i to a distribution over z, and then minimize the KL divergence between q(z_i...
