excerpt: "Drones take out Saudia Arabian oil facilities:&hellip;Asymmetric warfare meets critical global infrastructure&hellip;Houthi rebels from Yemen have taken credit for using a fleet of 10 drones* to attack two Saudi Aramco oil facilities. &ldquo;It is quite an impressive, yet worrying, technological feat,&rdquo; James Rogers, a drone expert, told CNN. &ldquo;Long-range precision strikes are not easy to achieve&rdquo;.  &nbsp; *These drones look more like missiles than typical rotor-based machines.
Why this matters: Today, these drones were likely navigated to their target by hand and/or via GPS coordinates. In a few years, increasingly autonomous AI systems will make drones like these more maneuverable and likely harder to track and eliminate. I think tracking the advance of this technology is important because otherwise we&rsquo;ll be surprised by a tragic, large-scale event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s oil supply disrupted after drone attacks: sources (Reuters).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Yemen&rsquo;s Houthi rebels claim a &lsquo;large-scale&rsquo; drone attack on Saudi oil facilities (CNN).

Facebook teaches AI to play games using language:&hellip;Planning with words&hellip;Facebook is trying to create smart AI systems by forcing agents to express their plans in language, and to then convert these written instructions into actions. They&rsquo;ve tested out this approach in a new custom-designed strategy game (which they are also releasing as open source).&nbsp;&nbsp;
How to get machines to use language: The approach involves training agents using a two-part network which contains an &lsquo;instructor&rsquo; system along with an &lsquo;executor&rsquo; system. The instructor takes in observations and converts them into written instructions (e.g., &ldquo;build a tower near the base&rdquo;), and the executor takes in these instructions and converts them into actions via the games inbuilt API. Facebook generated the underlying language data for this by having humans working together in &ldquo;instructor-executor pairs&rdquo; while playing the game, generating a dataset of 76,000 pairs of written instructions and actions across 5,392 games.&nbsp;
MiniRTSv2: Facebook is also releasing MiniRTSv2, a strategy game it developed to test out this research approach. &ldquo;Though MiniRTSv2 is intentionally simpler and easier to learn than commercial games such as DOTA 2 and StarCraft, it still allows for complex strategies that must account for large state and action spaces, imperfect information (areas of the map are hidden when friendly units aren&rsquo;t nearby), and the need to adapt strategies to the opponent&rsquo;s actions,&rdquo; the Facebook researchers write. &ldquo;Used as a training tool for AI, the game can help agents learn effective planning skills, whether through NLP-based techniques or other kinds of training, such as reinforcement and imitation learning.&rdquo;
Why this matters: I think this research is basically a symptom of larger progress in AI research: we&rsquo;re starting to develop complex systems that combine multiple streams of data (here: observations extracted from a game engine, and natural language commands) and require our AI systems to perform increasingly sophisticated tasks in response to the analysis of this information (here, controlling units in a complex, albeit small-scale, strategy game).&nbsp;
One cool thing this reminded me of: Earlier work by researchers at Georgia Tech, who trained AI agents to play games while printing out their rationale for their moves &ndash; e.g, an agent which was trained to play &lsquo;Frogger&rsquo; while providing a written rationale for its own moves (Import AI: 26).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Teaching AI to plan using language in a new open source strategy game (Facebook AI).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Hierarchical Decision Making by Generating and Following Natural Language Instructions (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the code for MiniRTS (Facebook AI GitHub).

McDonald&rsquo;s + speech recognition = worries for workers:&hellip;What happens when &lsquo;AI industrialization&rsquo; hits one of the world&rsquo;s largest restaurants&hellip;Microsoft has acquired Apprente, an AI startup that had the mission of building &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s best voice-based conversational system that delivers a human-level customer service experience&ldquo;.&nbsp; The startup&rsquo;s technology was targeted at drive-thru restaurants. Now, fast food giant has acquired the company to help start an internal technology development group named McD Tech Labs, which the company hopes will help it hire &ldquo;additional engineers, data scientists and other advanced technology experts&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Why this matters: As AI industrializes, more and more companies from other sectors are going to experiment with it. McDonald&rsquo;s has already been trying to digtize chunks of itself &ndash; see the arrival of touchscreen-based ordering kiosks to supplement human workers in its restaurants. With this acquisition, McDonalds appears to be laying the groundwork for automating large chunks of its drive-thru business, which will likely raise larger questions about the effect AI is having on employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: McDonald&rsquo;s to Acquire Apprente, An Early Stage Leader in Voice Technology (McDonald&rsquo;s newsroom).

How an AI might see a city: DublinCity:&hellip;Helicopter-gathered dataset gives AIs a new perspective on towns&hellip;AI systems &lsquo;see&rsquo; the world differently to humans: where humans use binocular vision to analyze their surroundings, AI systems can use a multitude of cameras, along with other inputs like radar, thermal vision, LiDAR point clouds, and so on. Now, researchers with Trinity College Dublin, the University of Houston-Victoria, ETH Zurich, and Tarbiat Modares University, have developed &lsquo;DublinCity&rsquo;, an annotated LiDAR point cloud of the city of Dublin in Ireland.
The data details of DublinCity: The datasets is made up of over 260 million laser scanning points which the authors have painstakingly labelled into around 100,000 distinct objects, ranging from buildings, to trees, to windows and streets. These labels are hierarchical, so a building might also have labels applied to its facade, and within its facade it might have labels applied to various windows and doors, et cetera. &ldquo;To the best knowledge of the authors, no publicly available LiDAR dataset is available with the unique features of the DublinCity dataset,&rdquo; they write. The dataset was gathered in 2015 via a LiDAR scanner attached to a helicopter &ndash; this compares to most LiDAR datasets which are typically gathered at the street level.&nbsp;
A challenge for contemporary systems: In tests, three contemporary baselines (PointNet, PointNet++, and So-Nets) show poor performance properties when tested on DublinCity, obtaining classification scores in the mid-60s on the dataset. &ldquo;There is still a huge potential in the improvement of the performance scores,&rdquo; the researchers write. &ldquo;This is primarily because [the] dataset is challenging in terms of structural similarity of outdoor objects in the point cloud space, namely, facades, door and windows.&rdquo;
Why this matters: Datasets like Dublin City help define future challenges for researchers to target, so will potentially fuel progress in AI research. Additionally, large-scale datasets like this seem like they could potentially be useful to the artistic community, giving them massive datasets to play with that have novel attributes &ndash; like a dataset that consists of the ghostly outlines of a city gathered via a helicopter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: DublinCity: Annotated LiDAR Point Cloud and its Applications (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the…"
