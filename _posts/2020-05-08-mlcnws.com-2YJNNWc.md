excerpt: "The 3rd international workshop on machine learning in clinical neuroimaging (MLCN2020) aims to bring together the top researchers in both machine learning and clinical neuroimaging. This year the workshop is organized in two tracks 1) machine learning and 2) clinical neuroimaging.



The machine learning track seeks novel contributions that address current methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous clinical neuroimaging data using stable, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



Spatio-temporal brain data analysisStructural data analysisGraph theory and complex network analysisLongitudinal data analysisModel stability and interpretabilityModel scalability in large neuroimaging datasetsMulti-source data integration and multi-view learningMulti-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modelingDomain adaptation, data harmonization, and transfer learning in neuroimagingUnsupervised methods for stratifying brain disordersDeep learning in clinical neuroimagingModel uncertainty in clinical predictionsIn the clinical neuroimaging track, we invite the community to submit applications of existing machine learning approaches to address major challenges towards reaching precision medicine for brain disorders. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
