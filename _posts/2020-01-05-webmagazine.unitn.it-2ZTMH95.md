excerpt: "DA2PL 2020 (From Multiple Criteria Decision Aid to Preference Learning) aims to bring together researchers from decision analysis and machine learning. It provides a forum for discussing recent advances and identifying new research challenges in the intersection of both fields, thereby supporting a cross-fertilisation of these disciplines. Following the four previous editions of this workshop, which took place in Mons in 2012, Paris in 2014, Paderborn in 2016 and Poznan in 2018, DA2PL 2020 will be held at the University of Trento, Trento - Italy."
