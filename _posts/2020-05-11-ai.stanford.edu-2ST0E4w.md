excerpt: "How do you teach a robot to pack your groceries into different boxes? While modern industrial robots are incredibly capable and precise, they require tremendous expertise to program and are designed to execute the exact same motion millions of times. Trying to program a robot to be able to pick up any kind of groceries, each with different characteristics, geometries, and weight, and pack them in the right boxes, would be incredibly difficult."

### Leveraging Compositionality for One-Shot Imitation Learning

How do you teach a robot to pack your groceries into different boxes? While modern industrial robots are incredibly capable and precise, they require tremendous expertise to program and are designed to execute the exact same motion millions of times. Trying to program a robot to be able to pick up any kind of groceries, each with different characteristics, geometries, and weight, and pack them in the right boxes, would be incredibly difficult.
