### Accelerate OpenCV: Optical Flow Algorithms with NVIDIA Turing GPUs | NVIDIA Developer Blog

OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision and machine learning software library with many computer vision algorithms including identifying objects, identifying actions, and tracking movements. The tracking algorithms use optical flow to compute motion vectors that represent the relative motion of pixels (and hence objects) between images. Computation of optical flow vectors is a computationally …
