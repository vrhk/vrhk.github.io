### [D] I have been doing a project on fruit detection using yolov4. But my model is too biased to one or more category. Later I was insisted to using equal number of images. But category A has 500 images with 10-20 bounding boxes in the image and B has 500 with 2-3 bounding box.

Should the image be equal for my 70 classes or does the bounding box should be equal?
