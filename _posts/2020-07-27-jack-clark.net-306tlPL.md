excerpt: "WordCraft: RL + Language&hellip;Want smarter machines? Teach them alchemy (?)&hellip;Researchers with UCL and the University of Oxford have built WordCraft, an RL-based environment for testing out agents that need to use language to reason their way through the world. The RL environment is a simplified text-only version of the game Little Alchemy 2, where you craft objects by combining other objects together (e.g, combining &lsquo;water&rsquo; and &lsquo;earth&rsquo; makes mud). &ldquo;Learning policies that generalize to unseen entities and combinations requires commonsense knowledge about the world&rdquo;, they write. The environment is also efficient, running at 8000 steps a second on a single machine, making it a useful choice for compute-starved researchers.Why this matters: In the next few years we&rsquo;re going to discover whether we need specialized architectures to do generative, combinatorial reasoning, or whether large-scale pre-trained models (e.g, GPT-3) with some fine-tuning can do these tasks themselves. Systems like WordCraft will help us test out these sorts of questions. &nbsp; Read more: WordCraft: An Environment for Benchmarking Commonsense Agents (arXiv). ####################################################
Survey: Help improve the AI Index:The AI Index, a Stanford initiative to track, measure, and analyze progress in artificial intelligence, is scaling up its efforts ahead of its annual report. If you&rsquo;d like to offer feedback on the 2019 AI Index report, areas for the AI Index to look into this year, and other advice, please fill out the survey. Why this matters: I think measurement is, eventually, inextricably linked with policy &ndash; at some point, we&rsquo;ll figure out ways to assess and measure the traits of various aspects of AI, and these measures will get baked into the larger societal policy apparatus. The idea for the AI Index is to openly prototype different ways of measuring and describing progress in AI, so when policymakers head in this direction there&rsquo;ll be some prior work. (The AI Index is one of among a multitude of such measurement schemes, I should note).  &nbsp; Read more at the AI Index official site. &nbsp; Read the 2019 AI Index report here.  &nbsp; Take the survey here (Stanford University Qualtrics survey). ####################################################AI + Satellite Communication:How might AI change the field of satellite communication?

A good example of this is a new project from Stanford that lets you anonymize faces of protestors (so if you want to circulate a photograph on social media, you don&rsquo;t put them in danger of identification and arrest).
