excerpt: "AWS customers often choose to run machine learning (ML) inferences at the edge to minimize latency. In many of these situations, ML predictions must be run on a large number of inputs independently.  For example, running an object detection model on each frame of a video. In these cases, parallelizing ML inferences across all available CPU/GPUs […]"

### Parallelizing across multiple CPU/GPUs to speed up deep learning inference at the edge | Amazon Web Services

AWS customers often choose to run machine learning (ML) inferences at the edge to minimize latency. In many of these situations, ML predictions must be run on a large number of inputs independently.  For example, running an object detection model on each frame of a video. In these cases, parallelizing ML inferences across all available CPU/GPUs […]
