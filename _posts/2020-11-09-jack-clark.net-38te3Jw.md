excerpt: "What are Moonshots and how do we build them?&hellip;Plus, why Moonshots are hard&hellip;AI researcher Eirini Malliaraki has read a vast pile of bureaucratic documents to try and figure out how to make &lsquo;moonshots&rsquo; work &ndash; the result is a useful overview of the ingredients of societal moonshots and ideas for how to create more of them. A moonshot, as a reminder, is a massive project that, according to Malliaraki, &ldquo;has the potential to change the lives of dozens of millions of people for the better; encourages new combinations of disciplines, technologies and industries; has multiple, bottom-up diverse solutions; presents a clear case for technical and scientific developments that would otherwise be 5&ndash;7x more difficult for any actor or group of actors to tackle&rdquo;. Good examples of successful moonshots include the Manhattan Project, the Moon Landing, and the sequencing of the human genome. What&rsquo;s hard about Moonshots? Moonshots are challenging because they require sustained effort over multiple years, significant amounts of money (though money alone can&rsquo;t create a moonshot), and also require infrastructure to ensure they work over the long term. &ldquo;Moonshots need to be managed through an agile (cliche) and adaptive process as they may run over several years and involve hundreds of organisations and individuals. A lot of thinking has gone into appropriate funding structures, less so into creating &ldquo;attractors&rdquo; for organisational and systemic collaborations,&rdquo; Malliaraki notes.Why this matters: Silver bullets aren&rsquo;t real and don&rsquo;t kill werewolves, but Moonshots can be real and &ndash; if well scoped enough &ndash; can kill the proverbial werewolf. I want to live in a world where society is constantly gathering together resources to create more of these silver bullets &ndash; not only is it more exciting, but it&rsquo;s also one of the best ways for us to make massive, scientific progress. &ldquo;I want to see many more technically ambitious, directed and interdisciplinary moonshots that are fit for the complexities and social realities of the 21st century and can get us faster to a safe and just post-carbon world,&rdquo; Malliaraki writes &ndash; here, here! &nbsp; Read more: Architecting Moonshots (Eirini Malliaraki, Medium). ###################################################Walmart cancels robotics push:&hellip;Ends ties with startup, after saying in January it planned to roll the robots out to 1,000 stores&hellip;Walmart has cut ties with Bossa Nova Robotics, a robot startup, according to the Wall Street Journal.
