### Building a deep neural net–based surrogate function for global optimization using PyTorch on Amazon SageMaker | Amazon Web Services

Optimization is the process of finding the minimum (or maximum) of a function that depends on some inputs, called design variables. Customer X has the following problem: They are about to release a new car model to be designed for maximum fuel efficiency. In reality, thousands of parameters that represent tuning parameters relating to the […]
