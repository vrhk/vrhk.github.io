AnnouncementsMar 24, 2020 -ICML 2020 will now be a fully remote conference &ndash; see the letter from the organisers. This means we will have a virtual workshop!Mar 10, 2020 &ndash; ML for Global Health was accepted as an official workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).



Overview



Machine learning is increasingly being applied to problems in the healthcare domain. However, there is a risk that the development of machine learning models for improving health remain focused within areas and diseases which are more economically incentivised and resourced. This presents the risk that as research and technological entities aim to develop machine-learning- assisted consumer healthcare devices, or bespoke algorithms for their populations within a certain geographical region, that the challenges of healthcare in resource-constrained settings will be overlooked. The predominant research focus of machine learning for healthcare in the &ldquo;economically advantaged&rdquo; world means that there is a skew in our current knowledge of how machine learning can be used to improve health on a more global scale &ndash; for everyone. This workshop aims to draw attention to the ways that machine learning can be used for problems in global health, and to promote research on problems outside high-resource environments.



Global health is a multidisciplinary area of study which focuses on &ldquo;improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide&rdquo;. &ldquo;We should not restrict global health to health-related issues that literally cross international borders. Rather, in this context, global refers to any health issue that concerns many countries or is affected by transnational determinants, such as climate change or urbanisation, or solutions, such as polio eradication.&rdquo;[1].&nbsp;
