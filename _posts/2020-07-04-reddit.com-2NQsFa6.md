### [R] Having the right development set is more important than doing K-fold CV for developing the convolutional neural network model (CNN). The way you partition the development sets into training and in-training validation sets does impact the CNN performance on the unseen test set.

However, it is difficult to find the optimal development set in the medical domain and especially if you have data from a single institution....
