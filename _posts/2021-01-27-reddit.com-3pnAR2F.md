### [D] Has anyone here gotten any advantage in inference/training time, or memory footprint by using sparse models instead of Dense? Theoretically, sparsity sounds efficient, but I haven't personally able to get a slight boost even with 90x sparse Resnets.

I guess it is because the operations are still not optimised for sparse models. Wondering if anyone here has had any success?
