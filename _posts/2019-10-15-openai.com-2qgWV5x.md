### Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand

We've trained a pair of neural networks to solve the Rubik’s Cube with a human-like robot hand. The neural networks are trained entirely in simulation, using the same reinforcement learning code as OpenAI Five [/blog/openai-five] paired with a new technique called Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR). The system can handle situations it never saw during training, such being prodded by a stuffed giraffe. This shows that reinforcement learning isn't just a tool for virtual tasks, but can solve ph
