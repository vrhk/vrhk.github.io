excerpt: "UK Amazon competitor adds to its robots:&hellip;Ocado acquires Kindred&hellip;Ocado, the Amazon of the UK, has acquired robotics startup Kindred, which they&rsquo;ll plan to use at their semi-automated warehouses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ocado has made meaningful progress in developing the machine learning, computer vision and engineering systems required for the robotic picking solutions that are currently in production at our Customer Fulfilment Centre (&ldquo;CFC&rdquo;) in Erith,&rdquo; said Tim Steiner, Ocado CEO, in a press release. &ldquo;Given the market opportunity we want to accelerate the development of our systems, including improving their speed, accuracy, product range and economics&rdquo;.Kindred was a robot startup that tried to train its robots via reinforcement learning (Import AI 87), and tried to standardize how robot experimentation works (#113). It was founded by some of the people behind quantum computing startup D-Wave and spent a few years trying to find product-market fit (which is typically challenging for robot companies). Why this matters: As companies like Amazon have shown, a judicious investment in automation can have surprisingly significant payoffs for the company that bets on it. But those companies are few and far between. With its slightly expanded set of robotics capabilities, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to check back in on Ocado in a couple of years and see if there&rsquo;ve been surprising changes in the economics of the fulfilment side of its business. I&rsquo;m just sad Kindred never got to stick around long enough to see robot testing get standardized.  &nbsp; Read more: Ocado acquires Kindred and Haddington (Ocado website). &nbsp; View a presentation for Ocado investors about this (Ocado website, PDF). ###################################################Google explains why AI systems fail to adapt to reality:&hellip;When 2+2 = Bang&hellip;When AI systems get deployed in the real world, bad things happen.
