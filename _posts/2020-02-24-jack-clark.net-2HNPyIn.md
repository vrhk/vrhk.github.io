excerpt: "AI + Satellites = Climate Change Monitoring:&hellip;Deeplab v3 + Sentinel satellite &lsquo;SAR&rsquo; data = lake monitoring through clouds&hellip;Researchers with ETH Zurich and the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology have used machine learning to develop a system that can analyze satellite photos of lakes and work out if they&rsquo;re covered in ice or not. This kind of capability is potentially useful when building AI-infused earth monitoring systems. Why they did it: The researchers use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 satellite. SAR is useful because it sees through cloud cover, so they can analyze lakes under variable weather conditions. &ldquo;Systems based on optical satellite data will fail to determine these key events if they coincide with a cloudy period,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;The temporal resolution of Sentinel-1 falls just short of the 2-day requirement of GCOS, still it can provide an excellent &ldquo;observation backbone&rdquo; for an operational system that could fill the gaps with optical satellite data&rdquo;.How they did it: The researchers paired the Sentinel satellite data with a Deeplab v3+ semantic segmentation network. They tested their approach against three lakes in Switzerland (Sils, Silvaplana, St. Moritz) over satellite data gathered of the lakes during two separate winters (2016/17, and 2017/18). They obtain accuracy scores of around 95%, and find that the network does a reasonable job of identifying when lakes are frozen. Why this matters: Papers like this show how people are increasingly using AI techniques as a kind of plug&amp;play sensing capability, where they assemble a dataset, train a classifier, and then either build or plan an automated system based on the newly created detector.  &nbsp; Read more: Lake Ice Detection from Sentinel-1 SAR with Deep Learning (arXiv).####################################################Waymo dataset + LSTM = a surprisingly well-performing self-driving car prototype:&hellip;Just how far can a well-tuned LSTM get you?&hellip;Researchers with Columbia University want to see how smart a self-driving car can get if it&rsquo;s trained in a relatively simple way on a massive dataset. To that end, they train a LSTM-based system on 12 input features from the Waymo Open Dataset, a massive set of self-driving car data released by Google last year (Import AI 161). Performance of a well-tuned LSTM: In tests, an LSTM system trained with all the inputs from all the cameras on the car gets a minimum loss of about 0.1327. That&rsquo;s superior to other similarly simple systems based on technologies like convolutional neural nets, or gradient boosting. But it&rsquo;s a far cry from the 99.999% accuracy I think most people would intuitively want in a self-driving car. Why this matters: I think papers like this emphasize the extent to which neural nets are now utterly mainstream in AI research. It also shows how industry can inflect the type of research that gets conducted in AI purely by releasing its own datasets, which become the environments academics use to test, calibrate, and develop AI research approaches.  &nbsp; Read more: An LSTM-Based Autonomous Driving Model Using Waymo Open Dataset (arXiv). ####################################################Votefakes: Indian politician uses synthetic video to speak to more voters:&hellip;Deepfakes + Politics + Voter-Targeting = A whole new way to persuade&hellip;An Indian politician has&nbsp; used AI technology to generate synthetic videos of themselves giving the same speech in multiple languages, marking a possible new tool that politicians will use to target the electorate.
