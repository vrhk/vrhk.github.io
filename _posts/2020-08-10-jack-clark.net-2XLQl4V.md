excerpt: "How Google predicted the COVID epidemic:&hellip;Cloud companies as 21st century weather stations&hellip;Modern technology companies are like gigantic sensory machines that operate at global scale &ndash; they can detect trends way ahead of smaller entities (e.g, governments), because they have direct access to the actions of billions of people worldwide. A new blog post from Google gives us a sense of this, as the company describes how it was able to detect a dramatic rise in usage of Google Meet in Asia early in the year, which gave it a clue that the COVID pandemic was driving changes in consumer behavior on its platform. Purely from demand placed on Google&rsquo;s systems, &ldquo;tt became obvious that we needed to start planning farther ahead, for the eventuality that the epidemic would spread beyond the region&rdquo;.Load prediction and resource optimization: Google had to scale Google Meet significantly in response to demand, which meant the company invested in tools for better demand prediction, as well as tweaking how its systems assigned hardware resources to services running Google Meet. &ldquo;By the time we exited our incident, Meet had more than 100 million daily meeting participants.&rdquo;  &nbsp; Read more: Three months, 30X demand: How we scaled Google Meet during COVID-19 (Google blog).###################################################ML alchemy: extracting 3D structure from a bunch of 2D photographs:&hellip;NeRF-W means tech companies are going to turn their userbase into a distributed, global army of 3D cartographers&hellip;It sounds like sci-fi but it&rsquo;s true &ndash; a new technique lets us grab a bunch of photos of a famous landmark (e.g, the Sistine Chapel), then use AI to figure out a 3D model from the images. This technique is called NeRF-W and was developed by researchers with Google as an extension of their prior work, NERF.How it works: NERF previously only worked on reconstructing objects from well composed photographs with relatively little variety.

I imagine that such data will eventually be used to bootstrap the training of AI systems, either by providing an easy-to-create quantity of 3D data, or perhaps for automatically extracting environments from reality and training AIs against them in simulation, then re-uploading them onto robots running in the real world.  &nbsp; Read more: NeRF in the Wild: Neural Radiance Fields for Unconstrained Photo Collections (arXiv).Check out videos at the paper overview site (Github).###################################################Blue River Technology: Tractors + machine learning = automated weed killers:&hellip;&rdquo;The machine needs to make real-time decisions on what is a crop and what is a weed&rdquo;&hellip;Agricultural robot startup Blue River Technologies is using machine learning to classify weeds on-the-fly, letting farmers automate the task of spraying crops with weedkillers.
