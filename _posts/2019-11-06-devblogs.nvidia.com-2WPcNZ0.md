excerpt: "INT4 Precision Can Bring an Additional 59% Speedup Compared to INT8 If there’s one constant in AI and deep learning, it’s never-ending optimization to wring every possible bit of performance out of a given platform. Many inference applications benefit from reduced precision, whether it’s mixed precision for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or INT8 for convolutional …"

INT4 Precision Can Bring an Additional 59% Speedup Compared to INT8 If there’s one constant in AI and deep learning, it’s never-ending optimization to wring every possible bit of performance out of a given platform. Many inference applications benefit from reduced precision, whether it’s mixed precision for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or INT8 for convolutional …
