### A Topology Layer for Machine Learning

Topology is a combinatorial property that is tricky to utilize in gradient based methods, but it is also a very useful and underexploited global feature of data. We present an easy-to-use TopologyLayer that allows for backpropagation through a continuous handle on Topology called Persistent Homology.
