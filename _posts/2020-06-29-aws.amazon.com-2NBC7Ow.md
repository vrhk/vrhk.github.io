### Introducing the open-source Amazon SageMaker XGBoost algorithm container | Amazon Web Services

XGBoost is a popular and efficient machine learning (ML) algorithm for regression and classification tasks on tabular datasets. It implements a technique known as gradient boosting on trees and performs remarkably well in ML competitions. Since its launch, Amazon SageMaker has supported XGBoost as a built-in managed algorithm. For more information, see Simplify machine learning […]
