excerpt: "From its institution as the Neural Networks Council in the early 1990s, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has rapidly grown into a robust community with a vision for addressing real-world issues with biologically-motivated computational paradigms. The Society offers leading research in nature-inspired problem solving, including neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems. Members contribute to the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms, emphasizing neural networks, connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained."

### Information on Special Issues - IEEE Computational Intelligence Society

From its institution as the Neural Networks Council in the early 1990s, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has rapidly grown into a robust community with a vision for addressing real-world issues with biologically-motivated computational paradigms. The Society offers leading research in nature-inspired problem solving, including neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems. Members contribute to the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms, emphasizing neural networks, connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained.
