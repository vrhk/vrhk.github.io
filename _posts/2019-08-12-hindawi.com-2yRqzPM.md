excerpt: "Unmanned Vehicle Networks (UVNs) are autonomous networks formed by self-organizing aerial, ground, or underwater vehicles. Research in these networks has steadily increased over recent years, especially in relation to next-generation civil applications like consumer product delivery, autonomous, and mobile environmental monitoring, search, and rescue and disaster management. However, the challenges that accompany many emerging applications for UVNs cannot alone be solved by static optimization models, especially if they are applied in complex and adverse environments."

### Recent Advances in Machine Learning for Unmanned Vehicle Networks

Unmanned Vehicle Networks (UVNs) are autonomous networks formed by self-organizing aerial, ground, or underwater vehicles. Research in these networks has steadily increased over recent years, especially in relation to next-generation civil applications like consumer product delivery, autonomous, and mobile environmental monitoring, search, and rescue and disaster management. However, the challenges that accompany many emerging applications for UVNs cannot alone be solved by static optimization models, especially if they are applied in complex and adverse environments.
