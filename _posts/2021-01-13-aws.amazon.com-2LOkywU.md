### How to train procedurally generated game-like environments at scale with Amazon SageMaker RL | Amazon Web Services

A gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Procgen Benchmark is a suite of 16 procedurally-generated gym environments designed to benchmark both sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning.  These environments are associated with the paper Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning (citation). Compared to Gym Retro, these environments have […]
