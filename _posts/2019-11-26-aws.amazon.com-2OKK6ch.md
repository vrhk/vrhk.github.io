### Automating financial decision making with deep reinforcement learning | Amazon Web Services

Machine learning (ML) is routinely used in every sector to make predictions. But beyond simple predictions, making decisions is more complicated because non-optimal short-term decisions are sometimes preferred or even necessary to enable long-term, strategic goals. Optimizing policies to make sequential decisions toward a long-term objective can be learned using a family of ML models […]
