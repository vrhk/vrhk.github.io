excerpt: "Enterprises continue to move towards automating business processes as they seek to be more cost-effective, reliable, and scalable. Technology-infused services enable them to reduce direct and indirect costs while also reducing human errors and improving productivity. In recent times, Business Process Automation has become an effective way to achieve these goals. The latest trends in automating business processes center around process digitization, process standardization, data integrity checks, workflow automation including robotic process automation, and generating actionable reports, views &amp; interfaces to empower the end-user. The next wave of technology advancements will transform business processes by leveraging recent advances in AI, including Analytics/Machine Learning (ML), Optimization methods, and Automation. The workshop will focus on the theme of advanced AI (including analytics, automation, and optimization) for the transformation of core enterprise processes as well as for other processes, such as Information Technology (IT) processes and software development processes. Both research (theoretical or applied) and real-world application papers are welcome."
