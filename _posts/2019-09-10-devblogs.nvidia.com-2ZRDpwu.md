### Getting Started with CUDA Graphs | NVIDIA Developer Blog

The performance of GPU architectures continue to increase with every new generation. Modern GPUs are so fast that, in many cases of interest, the time taken by each GPU operation (e.g. kernel or memory copy) is now measured in microseconds. However, there are overheads associated with the submission of each operation to the GPU – …
