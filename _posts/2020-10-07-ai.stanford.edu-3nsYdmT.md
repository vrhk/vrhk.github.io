### GTI: Learning to Generalize Across Long-Horizon Tasks from Human Demonstrations

It takes a lot of data for robots to autonomously learn to perform simple manipulation tasks as as grasping and pushing.

These tasks are usually short and relatively simple - for example, picking up a plastic bottle in a tray.
