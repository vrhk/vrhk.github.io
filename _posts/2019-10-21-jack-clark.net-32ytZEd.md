excerpt: "PyTorch gets smarter on mobile devices:&hellip;1.3 update adds efficiency-increasing experimental features&hellip;PyTorch, an AI programming framework that integrates nicely into the widely-used Python language, has got into version 1.3. The latest update for the software includes features for making it easier to train models with lower-precision, and also to deploy them onto mobile devices with limited computational budgets. Along with tools for making AI systems developed within PyTorch more interpretable.&nbsp;
Hardware support: AI frameworks are part of a broader, competitive landscape in AI development, and hardware/cloud support is where we can look for signs of success of a given framework. Therefore, it seems promising for PyTorch&rsquo;s prospects that it is now supported by Google&rsquo;s custom &ldquo;TPU&rdquo; processors, as well as being directly supported within Alibaba&rsquo;s cloud.&nbsp;
Why this matters: Programming languages, much like spoken languages, define the cultural context in which technology is produced. Languages are also tools of power in themselves &ndash; it&rsquo;s no coincidence that PyTorch&rsquo;s biggest backer is Facebook and the framework PyTorch is seeking to dethrone is TensorFlow; successful frameworks generate other strategic advantages for the company&rsquo;s that develop them (see: TensorFlow being written with some specific components that support TPUs, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: PyTorch 1.3 adds mobile, privacy, quantization, and named tensors (official PyTorch website).&nbsp;

Could drones let us build airborne communications networks?&hellip;&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, citizens, we are automatically dispatching the communication drones to restore service&rdquo;&hellip;Taiwanese researchers envision a future where drones are used as flying base stations, providing communications and surveillance services to dense areas. Getting there is going to be a challenge, as multiple technologies need to be matured for such a technology to be possible, they write in a position paper. But if we&rsquo;re able to surmount them, the advantages could be profound, giving civilizations the ability to create what can literally be described as a &lsquo;smart cloud&rsquo; (of drones!) at will.&nbsp;
What stands between us and a glorious drone future? The researchers think there are five challenges that stand between us and a glorious, capable drone future. These include:
Long-term placement: How can we build drones that can hover for long enough periods of time they could serve useful purposes for communications networks?
Crowd estimation: Can we integrate computer vision tech into our drones so they can automatically analyze crowds of people around them? (The answer here is &lsquo;yes&rsquo; but some of the technologies are still a bit juvenile. See Import AI #167).
3D placement: Where do you stick the drone to optimize for reliable communications?
Adaptive 3D placement: Can you automatically move the drone to new locations in 3D space according to data from another source? (E.g., can you predict where crowds are going to assemble and can you proactively move the drone there ahead of time?)
Smart back-haul: How do you optimize communications between your drones and their base stations?
Why this matters: Have you ever looked at the sky? It&rsquo;s big! There&rsquo;s room to do a lot of stuff in it! And with the recent advances in drone affordability and intelligence, we can expect our skies to soon gain a ton of drones for a variety of different purposes. I think it&rsquo;d be a nice achievement for human civilization if we can use drones to provide adaptive infrastructure, especially after natural disasters; papers like this get us closer to that future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Communications and Networking Technologies for Intelligent Drone Cruisers (Arxiv).&nbsp;

Testing robots with&hellip; weights, hockey sticks, and giraffes?Ghost Robotics, a startup making a small quadruped robot, showed off the stability of their machine recently by chucking a weight at it, knocking it off balance. Check out this tweet to see a short video of the robot nimbly recovering after being hit.&nbsp;
Robots &amp; perturbations: This video makes me think of all the different ways researchers are fooling around with robots these days, and it reminds me of Boston Dynamics pushing one of its robots over using a hockey stick, and in another video forcing its &lsquo;Spot&rsquo; quadruped to slip on a banana skin. Even OpenAI (where I work) got into the action recently, with a &ldquo;plush giraffe perturbation&rdquo; that it applied to a robot hand trying to manipulate a Rubiks cube.&nbsp;
Why this matters: I think these sorts of demonstrations give us a visceral sense of progress in robotics. What happens in a few decades when semi-sentient AI systems look at all of this violent human on robot content &ndash; how will they feel, I wonder?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the Ghost Robotics video here (Ghost Robotics Twitter).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch OpenAI&rsquo;s Plush Giraffe Perturbation here (OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman&rsquo;s Twitter account).

Tencent &amp; Mirriad team-up to insert adverts into existing videos:&hellip;Of all the gin-joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine [WITH A BOTTLE OF GORDON&rsquo;S GIN]&hellip;Tencent has partnered with AI startup Mirriad to use AI to insert advertisements into existing media, like TV shows and films. In other words: look forward to seeing a &ldquo;gin-joint&rdquo; in Casablanca full of prominent &ldquo;Gordon&rsquo;s&rdquo; gin bottles, or perhaps a Coca-Cola logo emblazoned on the side of a truck in Terminator. Who knows! &ldquo;With Mirriad&rsquo;s API, the integration will be fully automated with ease and speed to ultimately transform the way advertisers engage with their target audiences in content&rdquo;. Mirriad as a tech-heavy company, claiming to have 29 patents and/or patents pending, according to its website. &ldquo;We create ad inventory where none existed, offering a new revenue stream from existing assets,&rdquo; the company says.&nbsp;
Why this matters: Once people start making a ton of money via AI-infused businesses, then we can expect more investment in AI, which will lead to further use cases, which will further proliferate AI into society (for better or for worse). Deals like this show just how rapidly various machine learning techniques have matured, yielding new companies. It also shows that it&rsquo;s getting really cheap to edit recorded reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Mirriad Partners With Tencent, One of the World&rsquo;s Largest Video Platforms, to Reach Huge Entertainment Audiences with Branded Content Solution (PRNewsWire).&nbsp;

Deepfakes are helping people to fake everything:&hellip;What links UK PM Boris Johnson to a synthetic image? Read on to find out&hellip;In the past few years, people have started using synthetic images of people to help them carry out nefarious activities. Earlier this year, for instance, the Associated Press reported on a LinkedIn profile allegedly used by a spy that had a fake identity replete with a synthetic face for a profile picture. As the technology has become cheaper, easier to access, and more well known, more people have been using it for nefarious purposes. The latest? Allegations that Hacker House, a company run by Jennifer Arcuri (a startup executive who has been connected to UK PM Boris Johnson), may not be entirely real. The evidence? It seems like at least one person &ndash; &ldquo;Annie Tacker&rdquo; &ndash; connected to the company is actually a LinkedIn profile with a synthetic image attached and little else, according to sleuthing from journalist Phil Kemp.
