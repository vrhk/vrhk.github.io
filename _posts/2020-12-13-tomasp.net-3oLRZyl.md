excerpt: "Making a concept synonymous with the operations for working with it is an idea introduced by P. W. Bridgman to think about measurements in physics. A length measured by a ruler is a different concept than a length measured by the time it takes light to travel. However, what if we thought about programs in the same way? Is a program constructed manually the same as a program obtained by training a neural network?"

### Is deep learning a new kind of programming? Operationalistic look at programming

Making a concept synonymous with the operations for working with it is an idea introduced by P. W. Bridgman to think about measurements in physics. A length measured by a ruler is a different concept than a length measured by the time it takes light to travel. However, what if we thought about programs in the same way? Is a program constructed manually the same as a program obtained by training a neural network?
