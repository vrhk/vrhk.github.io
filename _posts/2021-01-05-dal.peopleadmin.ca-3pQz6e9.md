Positions at the Associate level may be considered in exceptional cases. As women have been historically underrepresented in Computer Science, this position is restricted to candidates who self-identify as women.

A successful candidate with a high level of research activity in the area of artificial intelligence may be recommended for a Canada CIFAR Artificial Intelligence Chair (<https://cifar.ca>) and/or an affiliation to the Vector Institute (<http://vectorinstitute.ai/>). The Faculty has research clusters in Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, Visualization &amp; Graphics, Systems, Networks &amp; Security, Algorithms &amp; Bioinformatics, and Computer Science Education. More information is available at <https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/research-industry/fcs_research.html>.

The Faculty of Computer Science is a research-intensive unit that currently comprises over 30 full-time research faculty including two Tier I CRC, two Tier II CRCs, a CIFAR AI chair, and many cross-appointments and adjunct faculty members. We are a fast-growing faculty in the university, with approximately 1400 students, one third of whom are graduate students at the Master’s or Doctoral level. The Faculty of Computer Science offers research-intensive and applied training at the undergraduate, Master’s, PhD, and postdoctoral levels, including the new Master of Digital Innovation program. The Faculty hosts the Dalhousie Institute for Big Data Analytics, which has academic and industry partnerships centred on deep learning and artificial intelligence. Evidence of a strong commitment to and aptitude for both research and teaching is essential. The successful candidate will be an outstanding scholar who holds or will have completed a PhD in Computer Science or a related area by the appointment date. Applicants should have demonstrated potential to establish  independent scholarly research. Evidence of publications with strong peer reference is essential (good journals/conferences and/or highly cited contributions). The ideal candidate will be  open to collaborative research  within the  Faculty.   The successful candidate will teach both undergraduate and graduate courses, develop graduate-level courses, and support the Faculty’s initiatives. The applicant will be expected to establish a strong externally funded research program, supervise graduate student research, and foster existing and new collaborations with NGOs, government, and/or industry, as well as with members of Dalhousie’s research community. Dalhousie University is committed to fostering a collegial culture grounded in diversity and inclusiveness. The university encourages applications from Indigenous persons, persons with a disability, racially visible persons, women, persons of a minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and all candidates who would contribute to the diversity of our community. For more information, please visit <https://www.dal.ca/hiringfordiversity>. All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority. Review of applications will begin February 3rd, 2021 and will continue until positions are filled. A complete application will include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, statements of research and teaching interests, sample publications, and the names, email addresses and physical addresses of three referees. Applicants are encouraged to indicate in their research statement how they see their research fit in one or more of the Faculty’s research focus areas. Candidates interested in the Human-Computer Interaction position should specify this in their cover letter. Candidates should also be prepared to have their referees forward their letters of reference upon request.
