excerpt: "Automating aerospace: China releases English &amp; Chinese air traffic control voice dataset:&hellip;~60 hours of audio collected from real-world situations&hellip;Chinese researchers from Sichuan University, the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration, and a startup called Wisesoft have developed a large-scale speech recognition dataset based on conversations between air-traffic control operators and pilots. The dataset &ndash; which is available for non-commercial use following registration &ndash; is designed to help researchers improve the state of the art on speech recognition in air-traffic control and could help enable further automation and increase safety in air travel infrastructure.
What goes into the ATCSpeech dataset? The researchers created a team of 40 people to collect and label real-time ATC speech for the research. They created a large-scale dataset and are releasing a slice of it for free (following registration); this dataset contains around 40 hours of Chinese speech and 19 hours of English speech. &ldquo;This is the first work that aims at creating a real ASR corpus for the ATC application with accented Chinese and English speeches,&rdquo; the authors write.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dataset contains 698 distinct Chinese characters and 584 English words. They also tag the speech with the gender of the speaker, the role they&rsquo;re inhabiting (pilot or controller), whether the recording is good or bad quality, what phase of flight the plane being discussed is in, and what airport control tower the speech was collected from.
Why care about having automatic speech recognition (ASR) in an air-traffic control context? The authors put forward three main reasons: it makes it easy to create automated, real-time responses to verbal queries from human pilots; robotic pilots can work with human air-traffic controllers via ASR combined with a text-to-speech (TTS) system; and the ASR can be used to rapidly analyze historical archives of ATC speech.&nbsp;
What makes air traffic control (ATC) speech difficult to work with?&nbsp;
Volatile background noise ; controllers communicate with several pilots through the same radiofrequency, switching back and forth across different audio streams
Variable speech rates &ndash; ATC people tend to talk very quickly, but can also talk slowly
Multilingual: English is the universal language for ATC communication, but domestic pilots speak with controllers in local languages.&nbsp;
Code-switching: People use terms that are hard to mis-hear, eg saying &ldquo;niner&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Mixed vocabulary: Some words are used very infrequently, leading to sparsity in the data distribution
Dataset availability: It&rsquo;s a little unclear how to access the dataset. I&rsquo;ve emailed the paper authors and will update this if I hear back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: ATCSpeech: a multilingual pilot-controller speech corpus from real Air Traffic Control environment (Arxiv).&nbsp;

You + AI + Lego = Become a Lego minifigure!Next year, lego fanatics who visit the Legoland New York Resort could get morphed into lego characters with the help of AI.&nbsp;
At the theme park, attendees will be able to ride in the &ldquo;Lego Factory Adventure Ride&rdquo; which uses &lsquo;HoloTrac&rsquo; technology to convert a human into a virtual lego character. &ldquo;That includes copying the rider&rsquo;s hair color, glasses, jewelry, clothing, and even facial expressions, which are detected and Lego-ized in about half a second&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; according to Gizmodo. There isn&rsquo;t much information available regarding HoloTrac online, but various news articles say it is built on an existing machine learning platform developed y Holovis and uses modern computer vision techniques &ndash; therefore, it seems likely this system will be using some of the recent face/body-morphing style transfer tech that has been developed in the broader research community.&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Why this matters: Leisure is culture, and as a kid who went to Legoland and has a bunch of memories as a consequence, I wonder how culture changes when people have rosy childhood memories of amusement park &lsquo;rides&rsquo; that use AI technologies to magically turn people into toy-versions of themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Lego Will Use AI and Motion Tracking To Turn Guests Into Minifigures at Its New York Theme Park (Gizmodo).&nbsp;

Amazon gets ready for the AI-based traveling salesman:&hellip;OR RI benchmark lets you test algorithms against three economically-useful logistics tasks&hellip;Amazon, a logistics company masquerading as an e-retailer, cares about scheduling more than you do. Amazon is therefore constantly trying to improve the efficiency with which it schedules and plans various things. Can AI help? Amazon&rsquo;s researchers have developed a set of three logistics-oriented tests that people can test AI systems against. They find that modern, relatively simple machine learning approaches can be on-par with handwritten systems. This finding may encourage further investment into applying ML to logistics tasks.
Three hard benchmarks:
Bin Packing: This is a fundamental problem which involves fitting things together efficiently, whether placing packages into boxes, or portioning out virtual machines across crowd infrastructure. (Import AI #93: Amazon isn&rsquo;t the only one exploring this &ndash; Alibaba researchers have explored using AI for 3D bin-packing).

Newsvendor: &ldquo;Decide on an ordering decision (how much of an item to purchase from a supplier) to cover a single period of uncertain demand&rdquo;. This problem is &ldquo;a good test-bed for RL algorithms given that the observation of rewards is delayed by the lead time and that it can be formulated as a Markov Decision Problem&rdquo;. (In the real world, companies typically deal with multiple newsvendor-esque problems at once, further compounding the difficulty.)

Vehicle Routing: This is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem; one or more vehicles need to visit nodes in a graph in an optimal order to satisfy consumer demand. The researchers implement a stochastic vehicle routing test, which is where one of the problem parameters vary within a probability distribution (e.g., number of locations, trucks, etc), increasing the difficulty.&nbsp;
Key finding and why this matters: For each of their benchmarks, the researchers &ldquo;show that trained policies from out-of-the-box RL algorithms with simple 2 layer neural networks are competitive with or superior to established approaches&ldquo;. This is interesting &ndash; for many years, people have been asking themselves when reinforcement learning approaches that use machine learning systems will outperform hand-designed approaches on economically useful, real world tasks, and for many years people haven&rsquo;t had many compelling examples (see this Twitter thread from me in October 2017 for more context). Discovering that ML-based RL techniques can be equivalent or better (in simulation!) is likely to lead to further experimentation and, hopefully, application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: ORL: Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks for Online Stochastic Optimization Problems (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the code for the benchmarks and baselines from here&nbsp; (or-rl-benchmarks, official GitHub).
