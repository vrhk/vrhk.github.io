### Digging into Feature-Rich Networks: unveiling connections in Big Data

The recent progress of methodologies and technologies in the fields of Big Data Analytics, from one side, and Machine/Deep Learning, from another side, has given a new impulse to research on complex real-world behaviors and phenomena, which can be conveniently modeled as feature-rich networks.
