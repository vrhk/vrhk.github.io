### [D] Universal Approximation Theorem does not hold for approximating discontinuous functions, yet neural networks are being used to approximate discontinuous functions

As part of my thesis, I'm getting familiar with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and I see them being used for approximating discontinuous...
