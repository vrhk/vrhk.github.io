Tencent plans to release its &lsquo;TLeague&rsquo; software to help:&hellip;Tools for large-scale AI training&hellip;Tencent has recently trained AI systems to do well at strategy games like StarCraft II, VizDoom, and Bomberman-clone &lsquo;Pommerman&rsquo;. To do that, it has built &lsquo;TLeague&rsquo;, software that it can use to train Competitive Self Play Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (CSP-MARL) AI systems. TLeague comes with support for algorithms like PPO and V-Trace, and training regimes like Population Based Training.  &nbsp; Read more: TLeague: A Framework for Competitive Self-Play based Distributed Multii-Agent Reinforcement Learning (arXiv).  &nbsp; Get the code: TLeague will eventually be available on Tenceent&rsquo;s GitHub page, according to the company. ###################################################10 smart drones that (might) come to the USA:&hellip;FAA regulations key to unlocking crazy new drones from Amazon, Matternet, etc&hellip;The US, for many years a slow mover on drone regulation, is waking up. The Federal Aviation Administration recently published &lsquo;airworthiness critiera&rsquo; for ten distinct drones. What this means is the FAA has evaluated a load of proposed designs and spat out a list of criteria the companies will need to meet to deploy the drones. Many of these new drones are designed to operate beyond the line of sight of an operator and a bunch of them come with autonomy baked in. By taking a quick look at the FAA applications, we can get a sense for the types of drones that might soon come to the USA.The applicants&rsquo; drones range from five to 89 pounds and include several types of vehicle designs, including both fixed wing and rotorcraft, and are all electric powered. One notable applicant is Amazon, which is planning to do package delivery via drones that are tele-operated.&nbsp;

###################################################King of Honor &ndash; the latest complex game that AI has mastered:&hellip;Tencent climbs the compute curve&hellip;Tencent has built an AI system that can play Honor of Kings, a popular Chinese MOBA online game. The game is a MOBA &ndash; a game designed to be played online by two teams with multiple players per team, similar to games like Dota2 or League of Legends. These games are challenging for AI systems to master because of the range of possible actions that each character can take at each step, and also because of the combinatorially explosive gamespace due to a vast character pool. For this paper, Tencent trains on the full 40-character pool of Honor of Kings.How they did it: Tencent uses a multi-agent training curriculum that operates in three phases. In the first phase, the system splits the character pool into distinct groups, then has them play each other and trains systems to play these matchups. In the second, it uses these models as &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; which train a single &lsquo;student&rsquo; policy. In the third phase, they initialize their network using the student model from the second phase and train on further permutations of players.How well they do: Tencent deployed the AI model into the official &lsquo;Honor of Kings&rsquo; game for a week in May 2020; their system played 642,047 matches against top-ranked players, winning 627,280 matches, with a win rate of 97.7%.Scale &ndash; and what it means: Sometimes, it&rsquo;s helpful to step back from analyzing AI algorithms themselves and think about the scale at which they operate. Scale is both good and bad &ndash; large scale computationally-expensive experiments have, in recent years, led to a lot of notable AI systems, like AlphaGo, Dota 2, AlphaFold, GPT3, and so on, but the phenomenon has also made some parts of AI research quite expensive. This Tencent paper is another demonstration of the power of scale: their training cluster involves 250,000 CPU cores and 2,000 NVIDIA V100 GPUS &ndash; that compares to systems of up to ~150,000 CPUs and ~3000 GPUs for things like Dota 2 (OpenAI paper, PDF).&nbsp; Computers are telescopes: These computer infrastructures like telescopes &ndash; the larger the set of computers, the larger the experiments we can run, letting us &lsquo;see&rsquo; further into the future of what will one day become trainable on home computers. Imagine how strained the world will be when tasks like this are trainable on home hardware &ndash; and imagine what else must become true for that to be possible. &nbsp; Read more: Towards Playing Full MOBA Games With Deep Reinforcement Learning (arXiv).
