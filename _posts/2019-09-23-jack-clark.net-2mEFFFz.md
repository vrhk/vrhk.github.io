excerpt: "San Diego wants smart, AI-infused streetlights; opposition group sounds alarm:&hellip;When technological progress meets social reality&hellip;The City of San Diego is installing thousands of streetlights equipped with video cameras and a multitude of other sensors. A protest group called the Anti Surveillance Coalition (ASC) wants to put a halt on the &lsquo;smart city&rsquo; program, pending further discussion with residents. &ldquo;I understand that there may be benefits to crime prevention, but the point is, we have rights and until we talk about privacy rights and our concerns, then we can&rsquo;t have the rest of the conversation&rdquo;, one ASC protestor told NBC.
Why this matters: This is a good example of the &lsquo;omniuse&rsquo; capabilities of modern technology &ndash; sure, San Diego probably wants to use the cameras to help it better model traffic, analyze patterns of crime in various urban areas, and generally create better information to facilitate more city governance. On the other hand, the protestors are suspicious that organizations like the San Diego Policy Department could use the data and video footage to target certain populations. As we develop more powerful AI systems, I expect that (in the West at least) there are going to be a multitude of conversations about how &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; we want our civil infrastructures to be, and what the potential constraints or controls are that we can place on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out more about the &lsquo;Smart City Platform&rsquo; here (official City of San Diego website).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Opposition Group Calls for Halt to San Diego&rsquo;s Smart Streetlight Program (NBC San Diego).

Want a few hundred thousand chest radiographs? Try MIMIC:Researchers with MIT and Harvard have released the &ldquo;MIMIC&rdquo; chest radiograph dataset, giving AI researchers 377,110 images from more than 200,000 radiographic studies. &ldquo;The dataset is intended to support a wide body of research in medicine including image understanding, natural language processing, and decision support,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: MIMIC-CXR Database (PhysioNet).&nbsp;

Google reveals how YouTube ranking works:&hellip;We&rsquo;re all just janitors servicing vast computational engines, performing experimentation against narrowly defined statistical metrics&hellip;Video recommendations are one of the most societally impactful forms of machine learning, because the systems that figure out what videos to recommend people are the systems that fundamentally condition 21st century culture, much like how &lsquo;channel programming&rsquo; for broadcast TV and radio influenced culture in the 20th century. Now, new research from Google shows how the web giant decides which videos to recommend to YouTube users.&nbsp;
How YouTube recommendations work: Google implements a multitask learning system, which lets it optimize against multiple objectives at once. These objectives include things like: &lsquo;engagement objectives&rsquo;, such as user clicks, and &lsquo;satisfaction objectives&rsquo; like when someone likes a video or leaves a rating.&nbsp;
Feedback loops &amp; YouTube: Machine learning systems can enter into dangerous feedback loops, where the system recycles certain signals until it starts to develop pathological behaviors. YouTube is no exception. &ldquo;The interactions between users and the current system create selection biases in the feedback,&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;For example, a user may have clicked an item because it was selected by the current system, even though it was not the most useful one of the entire corpus&rdquo;. To help deal with this, the researchers develop an additional ranking system, which tries to disambiguate how much a user likes a video, from how prevalent the video was in prior rankings &ndash; essentially, they try to stop their model becoming recursively more biased as a consequence of automatically playing the next video or the user consistently clicking only the top recommendations out of laziness.&nbsp;
Why this matters: I think papers like this are fascinating because they read like the notes of janitors servicing some vast machine they barely understand &ndash; we&rsquo;re in a domain here where the amounts of data are so vast that our methods to understand the systems are to perform live experiments, using learned components, and see what happens. We use simple scores as proxies for larger issues like bias, and in doing likely hide certain truthes from ourselves. The 21st century will be defined by our attempts to come up with the right learning systems to intelligently &amp; scalably constrain the machines we have created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Recommending what video to watch next: a multitask ranking system (ACM Digital Library).

100,000 free, generated faces:&hellip;When synthetic media meets stock photography&hellip;In the past five years, researchers have figured out how to use deep learning systems to create synthetic images. Now, the technology is moving into society in surprising ways. Case in point? A new website that offers people access to 100,000 pictures of synthetic people, generated via StyleGAN. This is an early example of how the use of synthetic media is going to potentially upend various creative industries &ndash; starting here with stock photography.&nbsp;
The dataset: So, if you want to generate faces, you need to get data from somewhere. Where did this data from from? According to the creators, they gained it via operating a photography studio, taking 29,000+ photos of 69 models over the last two years &mdash; and in an encouraging and unusual move, say they gained consent from the models to use their photos to generate synthetic people.&nbsp;
Why this matters: I think that the intersection of media and AI is going to be worth paying attention to, since media economics are terrible, and AI gives people a way to reduce the cost of media production via reducing the cost of things like acquiring photos, or eventually generating text. I wonder when we&rsquo;ll see the first Top-100 internet website which is a) content-oriented and b) predominantly generated. As a former journalist, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m thrilled about what this will do to the pay for human photographers, writers, and editors. But as the author of this newsletter, I&rsquo;m curious to see how this plays out!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the photos here (Generated.Photos official website)..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out more by reading the FAQ (Generated.Photos Medium).

A self-driving car map of Singapore:&hellip;Warm up the hard drives, there&rsquo;s now even more free self-driving car data!&hellip;Researchers with Singapore&rsquo;s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) have released the &ldquo;A*3D&rdquo; dataset &ndash; self-driving car dataset collected in a large area of Singapore.&nbsp;
The data details:&nbsp;
230,000 human-labeled 3D object annotates across 39,179 LiDAR point cloud frames.
Data captured at driving speeds of 40-70 km/h.
Location: Singapore.
Nighttime data: 30% of frames.
Data gathering period: The researchers collected data in March (wet season) and July (dry season) 2018.
Why this matters: A few years ago, self-driving car data was considered to be one of the competitive moats which companies could put together as they raced each other to develop the technology. Now, there&rsquo;s a flood of new datasets being donated to the research commons every month, both from companies &ndash; even Waymo, Alphabet Inc&rsquo;s self-driving car subsidiary! &ndash;&nbsp; and academia &ndash; a sign, perhaps, of the increasing importance of compute for self-driving car development, as well as a tacit a…"
