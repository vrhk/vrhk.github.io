excerpt: "You&rsquo;ve heard of expensive AI training. What about expensive AI inference?&hellip;On the challenges of deploying GPT-2, and other large models&hellip;In the past year, organizations have started training ever-larger AI models. The size of these models has now grown enough that they&rsquo;ve started creating challenges for people who want to deploy them into production. A new post on Towards Data Science discusses some of these issues in relation to GPT-2:&ndash; Size: Models like GPT-2 are large (think gigabytes not megabytes), so embedding them in applications is difficult. &ndash; Compute utilization: Sampling an inference from the model can be CPU/GPU-intensive, which means it costs quite a bit to set up the infrastructure to run these models (just ask AI Dungeon). &ndash; Memory requirements: In the same way they&rsquo;re compute-hungry, new models are memory-hungry as well. Why this matters: Today, training AI systems is very expensive, and sampling from trained models is cheap. With some new large-scale models, it could become increasingly expensive to sample from the models as well. How might this change the types of applications these models get used for, and the economics associated with whether it makes sense to use them? &nbsp; Read more: Too big to deploy: How GPT-2 is breaking production (Towards Data Science). ####################################################AI versus AI: Detecting model-poisoning in federated learning ..Want to find the crook?
