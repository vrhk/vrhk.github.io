### Generating compositions in the style of Bach using the AR-CNN algorithm in AWS DeepComposer | Amazon Web Services

AWS DeepComposer gives you a creative way to get started with machine learning (ML) and generative AI techniques. AWS DeepComposer recently launched a new generative AI algorithm called autoregressive convolutional neural network (AR-CNN), which allows you to generate music in the style of Bach. In this blog post, we show a few examples of how […]
