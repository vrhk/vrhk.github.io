### Pruning machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker Debugger and Amazon SageMaker Experiments | Amazon Web Services

In the past decade, deep learning has advanced many different areas, such as computer vision and natural language processing. State-of-the-art models now achieve near-human performance in tasks such as image classification. Deep neural networks can achieve this because they consist of millions of parameters that you train on large training datasets. For instance, the BERT […]
