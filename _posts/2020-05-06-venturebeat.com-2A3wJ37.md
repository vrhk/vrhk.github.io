### Facebook’s AI ‘learns how to learn’ to transport payloads using a drone

In a recent paper, Facebook and University of California, Berkely researchers propose an approach to payload-carrying drone flight planning that “learns how to learn” models of environmental dynamics. Results from experiments suggest the work could inform the development of future robots  — perhaps in warehouses or other industrial settings — that physically interact with and …
