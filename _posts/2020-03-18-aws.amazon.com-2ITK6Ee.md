### Reduce ML inference costs on Amazon SageMaker for PyTorch models using Amazon Elastic Inference | Amazon Web Services

Today, we are excited to announce that you can now use Amazon Elastic Inference to accelerate inference and reduce inference costs for PyTorch models in both Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EC2. PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that uses dynamic computational graphs. This allows you to easily develop deep learning models with imperative and […]
