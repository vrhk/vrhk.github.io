Specifically, Africa contains a variety of languages, some of which are broadly un-digitized, but spoken by millions of native speakers. In our new era of AI, this is a problem: if there isn&rsquo;t any digital data, then it&rsquo;s going to be punishingly hard to train systems to translate between these languages and other ones. The net effect is, sans intervention, languages which have a small to null digital footprint will not be seen or interacted with by people using AI systems to transcend their own cultures.&nbsp; But people are trying to change this &ndash; the main effort here is one called Masakhane, a pan-African initiative to essentially cold start a thriving NLP community that pays attention to local data needs.
