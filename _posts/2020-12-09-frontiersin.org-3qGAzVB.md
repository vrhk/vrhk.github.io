### Multimodal Behavioural AI for Wellbeing

With the rapid development of new technologies equipped with multiple sensors and AI, it becomes more realistic to have a synchronised integration of multimodal information to better adapt to the user needs. Behavioural modelling based on multimodal sensing has opened a new door to have a more natural perception of the user and create socially intelligent systems that can perceive user’s physical, psychological and cognitive states. Socially intelligent systems can well cater for data-driven personalisation and one particular area that can greatly benefit from such technologies is wellbeing. Wellbeing refers to physical, mental and social wellness and is fundamental to the overall health of an individual and extends beyond the classical definition of health. Recent years have witnessed a surge of assistive technologies that exploit multimodal data to inform users on their wellness-relevant metrics, including, but not limited to heart rate, steps, screen time, and physical activity.
