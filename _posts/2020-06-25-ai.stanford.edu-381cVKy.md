excerpt: "Merging into traffic is one of the most common day-to-day maneuvers we perform as drivers, yet still poses a major problem for self-driving vehicles. The reason that humans can naturally navigate through many social interaction scenarios, such as merging in traffic, is that they have an intrinsic capacity to reason about other people’s intents, beliefs, and desires, using such reasoning to predict what might happen in the future and make corresponding decisions1. However, many current autonomous systems do not use such proactive reasoning, which leads to difficulties when deployed in the real world. For example, there have been numerous instances of self-driving vehicles failing to merge into traffic, getting stuck in intersections, and making unnatural decisions that confuse others. As a result, imbuing autonomous systems with the ability to reason about other agents’ actions could enable more informed decision making and proactive actions to be taken in the presence of other intelligent agents, e.g., in human-robot interaction scenarios. Indeed, the ability to predict other agents’ behaviors (also known as multi-agent behavior prediction) has already become a core component of modern robotic systems. This holds especially true in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, which are currently being tested in the real world and targeting widespread deployment in the near future2.
