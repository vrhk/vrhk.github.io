### Google’s AI attempts to predict how yeast cell genes will express themselves

In a recent study conducted in collaboration with Calico Life Sciences, Google researchers built a “genome-wide” machine learning model for the regulation of gene expression — the process by which information from a gene is used to create functional protein or RNA — in a species of yeast. While the work focused on yeast, it …
