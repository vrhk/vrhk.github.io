excerpt: "Data augmentation is a de facto technique used in nearly every state-of-the-art machine learning model in applications such as image and text classification. Heuristic data augmentation schemes are often tuned manually by human experts with extensive domain knowledge, and may result in suboptimal augmentation policies. In this blog post, we provide a broad overview of recent efforts in this exciting research area, which resulted in new algorithms for automating the search process of transformation functions, new theoretical insights that improve the understanding of various augmentation techniques commonly used in practice, and a new framework for exploiting data augmentation to patch a flawed model and improve performance on crucial subpopulation of data."

### Automating Data Augmentation: Practice, Theory and New Direction

Data augmentation is a de facto technique used in nearly every state-of-the-art machine learning model in applications such as image and text classification. Heuristic data augmentation schemes are often tuned manually by human experts with extensive domain knowledge, and may result in suboptimal augmentation policies. In this blog post, we provide a broad overview of recent efforts in this exciting research area, which resulted in new algorithms for automating the search process of transformation functions, new theoretical insights that improve the understanding of various augmentation techniques commonly used in practice, and a new framework for exploiting data augmentation to patch a flawed model and improve performance on crucial subpopulation of data.
